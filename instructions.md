# TERENO Data Explorer
## ... a small demo app to view and define data expectations

This app demonstrates some core ideas about using [Great Expectations](https://great-expectations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to define and validate believes about incoming sensor data.

Think of it as a simple QA tool that can also be used to detect anomalies or system failures.

Currently raw data from the years 2018 and 2019 is located on a [MINIO](https://min.io) instance running at https://minio.cwerner.ai
